One of the inputs changes the color of the texts in the paragraphs and the other one changes the background color of paragraphs. Input values can only be hexadecimal values such as #cdcd67.

 <li>Create a page which contains a table with the students’ information. It consists from the following columns: Name, Age, Average Grade.With the last row of a table (it can be in the footer) you can add a new ordinary row to the table with new information. That last row contains inputs for the columns. So when enter values and there is no empty value by clicking “Enter” new row should be added to the table.Table is sortable with the column Age. That means when clicking on Age column first time, it should sort table by ascending order. When clicking the second time, table should be sorted by descending order.
